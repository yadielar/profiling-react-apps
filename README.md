# Profiling React Apps

A React app with various examples of common performance problems and optimizations.

## Featured examples

- **Calendar.** A calendar with many event cards where each card can be selected and the state change be propagated to the whole component tree.
- **Form.** A form with many fields where typing on an input causes the whole form to re-render on each keystroke.
- **Table.** A table with thousands of rows that makes the app unresponsive every time the user interacts with it.

## Running the app

This app was created using the **[React + TypeScript](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts)** template for Vite.

To serve the project locally for development, clone the repo and run:

```
